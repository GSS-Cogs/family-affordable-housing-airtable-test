		"Description": "This is a three-year rolling mortality indicator presented as a standardised mortality ratio. It is aimed at measuring the national and local standardised mortality ratio of the learning disabilities population compared to the general population. People with learning disabilities often have a shorter life expectancy than that of the general population. Some of the causes of mortality amongst this population are thought to be premature and preventable, this indicator therefore presents a useful contribution to monitoring improvements in the rates of mortality in the learning disabilities population.",
